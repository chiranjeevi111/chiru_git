### **What is a Conjunction?**
A **conjunction** is a word or a group of words that connects words, phrases, clauses, or sentences. Conjunctions act as bridges, linking ideas together to make sentences flow logically and smoothly.

Example:
- I like tea **and** coffee. (Connects two words)
- She is tired, **but** she is happy. (Connects two clauses)
- You can stay here **or** go home. (Connects two ideas))

---

### **Types of Conjunctions**
Conjunctions are divided into three main types:


1. **Coordinating conjunctions** connect equal elements (words, phrases, or clauses).
2. **Subordinating conjunctions** connect a dependent clause to an independent clause.
3. **Correlative conjunctions** work in pairs to connect elements and emphasize their relationship.

Letâ€™s explore each type with examples:

---

### **1. Coordinating Conjunctions**
These conjunctions join words, phrases, or clauses of equal importance. The most common coordinating conjunctions are remembered by the acronym **FANBOYS**:

- **F**or
- **A**nd
- **N**or
- **B**ut
- **O**r
- **Y**et
- **S**o

#### Examples:
- **For**: I went to bed early, **for** I was tired. (Explains reason)
- **And**: She bought apples **and** oranges. (Adds information)
- **Nor**: He doesnâ€™t like tea, **nor** does he like coffee. (Adds negative information)
    Yes, youâ€™re absolutely correct! The sentence "He doesnâ€™t like tea, nor does he like coffee" means:
    He does not like tea.
    He does not like coffee.
    "Nor" is followed by an auxiliary verb + subject + main verb.

    The structure is: Negative statement + , 
    + nor + auxiliary verb + subject + main verb.
    
    "Abhi does not go to the gym, nor does he go for a walk."


    He does not like writing, nor will he become a writer.



- **But**: I wanted to go, **but** it was raining. (Shows contrast)
- **Or**: Would you like tea **or** coffee? (Shows choice)
- **Yet**: She is small, **yet** she is strong. (Shows contrast)
    Have you met the new teacher yet?
    They havenâ€™t arrived yet.
    I havenâ€™t decided what to wear yet.
    As a Conjunction:
    She is very young, yet she is very talented.
    He studied hard, yet he failed the exam.
    The movie was long, yet it was interesting.
    
- **So**: It was raining, **so** I stayed home. (Shows result)

---

### **2. Subordinating Conjunctions**
These conjunctions join a dependent clause (a clause that cannot stand alone) to an independent clause (a complete sentence). They show relationships like cause, effect, time, condition, or contrast.

Common subordinating conjunctions include:
- **Because**, **since**, **as** (reason)
- **Although**, **though**, **even though** (contrast)
- **If**, **unless** (condition)
- **When**, **while**, **after**, **before**, **until** (time)
- **So that**, **in order that** (purpose)

#### Examples:
- **Because**: I stayed home **because** it was raining. (Reason)
- **Although**: **Although** she was tired, she finished her work. (Contrast)
- **If**: **If** you study hard, you will pass the exam. (Condition)
- **When**: I will call you **when** I reach home. (Time)
- **So that**: She studied hard **so that** she could pass the exam. (Purpose)

---

### **3. Correlative Conjunctions**
These conjunctions work in pairs to connect words, phrases, or clauses. They emphasize the relationship between the connected elements.

Common correlative conjunctions include:
- **Either...or**
- **Neither...nor**
- **Both...and**
- **Not only...but also**
- **Whether...or**

#### Examples:
- **Either...or**: You can have **either** tea **or** coffee. (Choice between two)
- **Neither...nor**: **Neither** John **nor** Mary came to the party. (Both options are negative)
- **Both...and**: She is **both** intelligent **and** hardworking. (Adds two qualities)
- **Not only...but also**: He is **not only** a teacher **but also** a writer. (Adds emphasis)
- **Whether...or**: I donâ€™t know **whether** to stay **or** leave. (Shows alternatives)

---

### **Key Points to Remember**
1. **Coordinating conjunctions** connect equal elements (words, phrases, or clauses).
2. **Subordinating conjunctions** connect a dependent clause to an independent clause.
3. **Correlative conjunctions** work in pairs to connect elements and emphasize their relationship.

---

### **Practice Examples**
1. Coordinating: I wanted to go to the park, **but** it started raining.
2. Subordinating: **Since** youâ€™re here, letâ€™s start the meeting.
3. Correlative: **Neither** the teacher **nor** the students were present.
